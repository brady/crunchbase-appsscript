About
----------------------

These functions allow one to make requests to the Crunchbase API from a Google Spreadsheet.

Included functions
---------------------------

  cbsearch(company, field)
    Performs a request for information from the specified field to the  http://api.crunchbase.com/v/1/company/company.js URL
      
	cbcity(company)
	  Returns the "headquarter city" of the specified company.
    (Cities follow a different structure than other fields.)
		
What else do I need?
--------------------

This library does not deal with the management of your tokens - only the interaction between
your code and the Foursquare API. If you are using it in an application that needs to use user
data via an auth_token, you will need to handle the storage of tokens for usage at later dates.
